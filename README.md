# Time-Series-Prediction
 In this project I created a  machine learning model that  predict the most recent prices  of a certain stock .
Sequence prediction problems have been around for a long time.  

With the recent breakthroughs that have been happening in data science, it is found that for almost all of these sequence prediction problems, Long short Term Memory networks, a.k.a LSTMs have been observed as the most effective solution.so i used it in my project to predict the close prices . 

to show the results run the "price_predection.py" script .
